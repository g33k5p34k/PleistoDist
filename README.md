# PleistoDist
Distance matrices between islands normalised over pleistocene time

## Introduction

PleistoDist is a tool for visualising and quantifying the effects of sea level change on islands over time. This tool consists primarily of a series of Python scripts that utilise standard ArcPy functions to generate maps of island extents for different sea level depths over Pleistocene time.
