# PleistoDist
Distance matrices between islands normalised over Pleistocene time

## Introduction

PleistoDist is a tool for visualising and quantifying the effects of Pleistocene-era sea level change on islands over time. This tool consists of a series of Python scripts that utilise standard ArcPy functions to generate maps of island extents for different Pleistocene-era sea level depths, and calculate the mean inter-island distance normalised over time. 

## Requirements

As this package requires ArcPy to function, users need to have the following installed in order to use PleistoDist:
* Python 2.x (preferably Python 2.7.x)
* ArcMap 10.6

Because this package was originally designed as an ArcGIS toolbox, it only runs on Windows machines. If there is sufficient demand, I will rewrite this package to work in QGIS or R. 

## Usage Instructions

This package can be run either as an ArcGIS toolbox or as a standalone Python script. The ArcGIS toolbox version comes with a small graphical user interface (GUI) but runs a little bit slower than the standalone Python script, so I would advise using the ArcGIS toolbox interface for smaller runs with fewer source points and/or fewer time intervals.
