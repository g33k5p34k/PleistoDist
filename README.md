# PleistoDist
Distance matrices between islands normalised over pleistocene time

## Introduction

PleistoDist is a tool for visualising and quantifying the effects of sea level change on islands over time. This tool consists primarily of a series of Python scripts that utilise standard ArcPy functions to generate maps of island extents for different sea level depths over Pleistocene time. 

## Requirements

As this package requires ArcPy to function, users need to have the following installed in order to use PleistoDist:
* Python 2.x (preferably Python 2.7.x)
* ArcMap 10.x

Because this package was originally designed as an ArcGIS toolbox, it only runs on Windows machines. If there is sufficient demand, I will rewrite this software package to work in QGIS or R.
